<h2>Printf</h2>
Printf is a 42 School project that challenges students to recreate the standard C library function printf. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of variable arguments (va_list), parsing, and formatting in C. This project serves as a fundamental exercise in implementing a versatile and widely used function.
